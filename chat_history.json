You're building a \"Beach Report\" app with React Native and Expo, providing real-time beach condition data. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** Display beach data for up to 5 beaches, with swipeable/arrow navigation. Prioritize GPS location or favorites.\n*   **Search Screen:** Find nearby beaches (GPS-based) or popular beaches. Allow users to search for specific beaches and add them to the home screen.\n*   **Beach Detail Screen:** Show a photo, water temp, surf height, tide levels, weather, UV index, sunrise/sunset, live cam link, current conditions, and flag warnings.\n*   **Favorites Screen:** Lists beaches that the user has favorited.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F0F8FF` (AliceBlue - a light, airy blue)\n    *   Text: `#202020` (A dark grey for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (A slightly lighter grey for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#4682B4` (SteelBlue - a calming, primary blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#B0E2FF` (PowderBlue - a softer, complementary blue)\n    *   Accent: `#FFA07A` (LightSalmon - a gentle, warm accent color)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White - for clean, distinct cards)\n    *   Highlight: `#ADD8E6` (LightBlue - subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default) or consider loading \"Roboto\" for a polished look.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Tab Structure:** The app will have four tabs: Home, Search, Favorites, and Settings. The tab layout is already set up in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.\n2.  **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Modify the existing `HomeScreen` component to display beach data.\n    *   Implement the swipeable/arrow navigation for switching between beaches.\n    *   Fetch beach data from NOAA, weather, and sunrise/sunset APIs (this will require backend integration, which I will address later). For now, use placeholder data.\n    *   Implement logic to prioritize beaches based on GPS location or favorites.\n3.  **Search Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/search.tsx`.\n    *   Implement a search bar to find beaches.\n    *   Display the nearest 5 beaches based on GPS or 5 popular beaches if GPS is unavailable.\n    *   Allow users to add beaches to the home screen.\n4.  **Favorites Screen (`app/(tabs)/favorite.tsx`):**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/favorite.tsx`.\n    *   Display a list of beaches that the user has favorited.\n5.  **Beach Detail Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/beach-detail.tsx`.\n    *   Pass beach data to this screen when a user selects a beach from the Home, Search, or Favorites screens.\n    *   Display all the required information (photo, water temp, surf height, etc.).\n6.  **Data Handling:**\n    *   For the initial version, use placeholder data for beach information.\n    *   Later, we'll integrate with NOAA, weather, and sunrise/sunset APIs to fetch real-time data.\n7.  **Styling:**\n    *   Apply the specified color palette and typography to all screens.\n    *   Use the `StyleSheet` API to create consistent styles.\n8.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Use `expo-router` for navigation between tabs and screens.\n    *   Ensure seamless transitions between screens.\n9.  **Floating Tab Bar:**\n    *   The `FloatingTabBar` component is already created. Ensure that the icons and labels match the design.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-15T17:19:02.002653"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Beach Report app!

Upload your beach images to an image hosting service like:\n   - **Imgur** (free, easy to use)\n   - **Cloudinary** (free tier available)\n   - **Your own web server**\n   - **GitHub repository** (if public)\n\n2.

I'll update the `imageUrl` property for each beach in the `beachData.ts` file\n\n### **Option 2: Use Local Images in Your Project**\n1. Add your images to the `assets/images/beaches/` folder in your project\n2. Name them consistently (e.g., `beach-1.jpg`, `beach-2.jpg`, etc.)\n3. Share the naming pattern with me\n4. I'll update the code to use local images with `require()` statements\n\n### **Option 3: Provide a Mapping**\nIf you already have the images hosted somewhere, just provide me with a list like:\n```\n1. Amelia Island - https://example.com/image1.jpg\n2. Anna Maria Island - https://example.com/image2.jpg\n3. Asbury Park - https://example.com/image3.jpg\n...\n```\n\nOnce you provide the image URLs or tell me which option you prefer, I'll update all 200 beaches in the `beachData.ts` file immediately!\n\n**Which option works best for you?**"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-16T16:34:13Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I would like to use local images in my project"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here's the plan to use local images in your project:\n\n1.  **Update `beachData.ts`:** Modify the `beachData.ts` file to reference local image files instead of URLs.

Here's what I've done:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n### 1. **Updated Beach Interface** (`types/beach.ts`)\n- Changed `imageUrl: string` to `image: any` to support local images using `require()`\n\n### 2. **Updated Beach Data** (`data/beachData.ts`)\n- Changed all beach entries from `imageUrl: 'https://...'` to `image: require('@/assets/images/beaches/beach-name.jpg')`\n- Each beach now references a local image file\n\n### 3. **Updated Components**\n- **Home Screen**: Changed `<Image source={{ uri: beach.imageUrl }} />` to `<Image source={beach.image} />`\n- **Search Screen**: Changed `<Image source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }} />` to `<Image source={item.image} />`\n- **Favorite Screen**: Changed `<Image source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }} />` to `<Image source={item.image} />`\n\n## Next Steps - Adding Your Beach Images:\n\nNow you need to add your actual beach images to the project. Here's how:\n\n1. **Create the beaches folder** in your assets:\n   - Create folder: `assets/images/beaches/`\n\n2. **Add your beach images** with these exact filenames (based on the beach names):\n   - `amelia-island.jpg`\n   - `anna-maria-island.jpg`\n   - `asbury-park.jpg`\n   - `assateague-island.jpg`\n   - `atlantic-city.jpg`\n   - ... and so on for all 200 beaches\n\n3. **Image naming convention**:\n   -
